    "description": "This dataset contains first-person perspective videos and sensor data of human hand manipulation tasks. Data is captured using a head-mounted ZED stereo camera that provides synchronized RGB, depth, and motion information. It is ideal for research in learning-based robotics manipulation, imitation learning, and vision-based control.",
